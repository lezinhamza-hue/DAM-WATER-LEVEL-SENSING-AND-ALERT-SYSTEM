This project is a real-time dam water level monitoring and alert system designed to enhance safety, efficiency, and sustainability in water resource management. It is built using an Arduino Uno, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor for accurate non-contact distance measurement, an I²C 16×2 LCD for real-time display, and a buzzer alarm that activates when critical thresholds are reached.

Water management in dams is one of the most critical tasks in infrastructure. Traditional methods rely heavily on manual monitoring, which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and unreliable during emergencies. Delayed action often results in dam overflows, flooding, destruction of property, damage to agriculture, and even loss of lives. On the other hand, poor water-level management can lead to shortages affecting irrigation, drinking water, and hydroelectric power generation.

This system solves these issues by providing a low-cost, automated, and scalable monitoring solution. The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to the water surface, and the Arduino processes this data to calculate the water level percentage. The LCD display shows the level both numerically and through a simple bar graph, ensuring quick and clear visualization. When the water level rises above 80–90% capacity, the buzzer is triggered, serving as an early-warning system for dam operators and communities.
